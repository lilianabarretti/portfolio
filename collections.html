						<h5><br><center>My collection is inspired by the beautiful peacock spider. Newly discovered and native to Australia, these tiny jumping spiders create the most elaborate visual displays in the animal kingdom. From fiery orange to splashy turquoise to glowing beige, this collection takes the vibrant colors and essence of the rainforest to the glitz and glamour of high-end culture. The asymmetrical lines, glistening crystals and acoustics of feathers definitely make a statement. The males peacock spiders are notable for their disco-like dance rituals, using their eight legs and bright, iridescent rumps to attract females. The ideal wearers are spontaneous and full of energy, live an eccentric life of adventure and spontaneity, and know their power and ability to reach their fullest potential.</center>

<p> <h3>Techniques &amp; materials</h3>
	<p> I created this design with a delicate, stretchy mesh fabric with white polyester on top. The white top is one piece where I added sleeves by attaching the edge to the inside. The neon yarn serves as embroidery and detailing, which is hand-stitched with clear thread. I used sheer fabric with merrowed edges for the organic shaped detailing on the skirt. The garments are both a size 6.

	<h3>Shine</h3>
		<h4>Design concept &amp; Purpose</h4>
<p>
This collection pieces is a white jumper, most similar to the men’s piece with its replicated shapes and spontaneous embroidery. The jumper has a mesh triangle at the back to make it edgy and less modest. It brings attention to the back of the garment as well as the plunging neckline at the front. The front purposely crosses and can be adjusted in how open or closed the wearer wants it, which gives the garment versatility in being worn more modest in the day versus more scandalous at night. The embroidery is spontaneous in some places and straight in others, resembling the sharp edges of sunlight’s gleam and the sun’s ability to light up darkness. This jumper embodies nothing but good vibes and indicates a bright future full of adventure and spontaneity.

			<p> <h3>Techniques &amp; materials</h3>
		<p>I created this design using white woven polyester. The front was cut-on fold and I draped the rest of the top half. I made the pant legs patterns using CAD software for precise measurements and accuracy. I used a white waistband elastic to make the sizing versatile and easy to throw on and get the day started. The neon embroidery yarn was kept together to keep its thickness and boldness. This collection piece is a size 8 on a mannequin.

		<p> <h3>Techniques &amp; materials</h3>
		<p>I made this dress out of a delicate mesh fabric. I superglued the neon yarn in place before using a clear thread to hand-stitch the embroidery details. Rather than your typical dress with two streps, this dress has several straps connecting the front to the back. Two pieces gracefully cross the front of the neck to resemble a choker, which is a popular accessory for spring. The yarn is thick and thin in certain spots to add more interesting detail and uniqueness. I used sheer fabric with merrowed edges to line the hem. The dress is a size 6.
