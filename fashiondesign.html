  <h3>American Beauty 2015</h3>
  <h4>Challenge Statement:</h4><p class="challenge"> Sketch, design, sew &amp; show a red dress for the Annual Women's Heart Care Forum to raise awareness for heart disease.
	</p>
	<p>
		The pantone color of my dress for the Red Dress Collection is called American Beauty. While most things in life are beautiful and glamorous, I want to raise awareness that heart disease is the leading killer amongst women. Through my design, I emphasize the power of the heart, the power of women, and the power to live the life every women deserves. My biggest statement is the heart beat hemline on the cocktail dress that resembles not only the high and low points in life that make us stronger, but also the power of the heart to beat 100,000 times per day. The electrifying, blue crystal embroidery on the long, red chiffon skirt resembles the blood flowing through 60,000 miles of blood vessels everyday. The embroidery is blue just like blood is blue before it hits oxygen and is exposed to reality. The heart is so powerful and full of energy that it has the ability to beat even if separated from the body because it has its own electrical pulse. My dress portrays a powerful, classy and sophisticated woman with a positive mindset and ability to achieve anything she sets her heart on.

<h3>Upcyled Dress</h3>

<p class="challenge">Upcycle a garment by reusing.</p>

 <h3>Sheer Elegance</h3>
 <h4>Challenge Statement</h4>
 <p class="challenge">Create a transformable garment.</p>
<p>My goal was to try to and make the garment transform in multiple ways, so I decided to create a high-end looking dress that would be for the runway, red carpet or high-class events that would have a detachable and reattachable accessory. The ruffles can detach and be placed from the shoulder to the ankle for a unique silhouette and style. They can be placed around the neck as a ruffled scarf, around the waist to accentuate the hips and serve as some sort of a peplum, or act as a ruffled hem on the bottom. The ruffles can also be worn as an accessory to another outfit, or even a scarf in the fall or winter. This is practical because a lot of dresses cannot be worn more than once due to pictures, old styles and the idea of “newness.”

	<h3>Exotic Reflection</h3>
	<h4>Challenge Statement</h4>
	<p class="challenge">Make a garment without fabric using unconventional materials.</p>
	<p>
		My	goal	was	to	use	my	materials	in
	ways	that	you	would	never	think	to	see	them.	White	rubber	mats	I	walk
	on	everyday	are	now	being	worn as	garments,	CD’s	full	of	memory	and
	music	are	now	broken	into	pieces,	and	pantyhose	are	now	structured
	with	wire	and	hardened	with	white	paint.	As	for	my	personal	style	in
	dress,	I	often	wear	bright,	flashy	colors,	big	statement	jewelry,	LED	light
	up	jackets	and	shoes,	and	apparel	full	of	sparkles	and	glitter. In	my
	design, I	cut	the	white	rubber	mats	in	creative	ways	to	create	an	edgy,
	sophisticated look	to	correspond	with	the	rest	of	the	dress	and	the	CD’s
	sharp	edges.	The	front	has	a	plunging	neckline	because	I	wanted	it	to	be
	scandalous	with	a	rebellious	feel.	The	top	is	very	symmetrical	in	the
	front,	with	an	uneven,	yet	symmetrical	hemline	on	both	sides	to	keep
	the	edgy	feel.	The	shoulder	cuffs	are	made	subtle	by	covering	the
	metallic	silver	foil	wrap with	the	same	material	as	the	rest	of	the	white
	garment.	This	is	to	keep	the	main	focus on	the	skirt.	While	much	is
	happening	in	the	front,	I	wanted to	add	a	little	Alexander	McQueen	flare
	by	adding	something	unique	and	different	to	the	back	of	the	top.	I
	vertically aligned	the	three	irregular,	white	painted	structures	I
	handmade and	put	them	in	ascending	order	of	size,	top	to	bottom,	as	the
	backbone	of	the	dress.	The	bottom	half	of	my	design	is	coved	in broken
	CD	pieces.	The	pieces	reflect bright,	holographic	colors	at	different
	angles.	The	skirt	extends	with	semi-sheer	rubber	strips	conjoined
	aesthetically	by	white,	vertical	lines	of	duct	tape.	The	uneven	hemline	of
	the	skirt	is	purposely	done	to	exaggerate	the exotic,	edgy	feel	and	work
	synonymously	with	the	top	hemline.	Overall	my	dress	takes	viewers	on
	an	exotic	journey	of	bright	colors,	strong	texture,	reflections,	sharp
	edges	and	abstract	structures	in	a	sophisticated,	edgy	way.

		<h3>Leather Shawl Jacket</h3>
		<h4>Challenge Statement</h4>
		<p class="challenge">Sketch, design, make pattern pieces and sew a jacket.</p>
		<p>
			I created a	sophisticated, edgy jacket with a shawl that add a more  feminine touch. The shawl is made of two different fabrics, the lining being more comfortable around the neck. The jacket can be zipped up with the shawl or slightly unzipped so that the shawl is on the shoulders. The slit in the front is another aesthetic. The jacket is assymmetrical, unique and stylish.

					<h3>Prismatic Sweater</h3>
					<h4>Challenge Statement</h4>
					<p class="challenge">Create a transformable garment with the use of technology, such as LED lights, nitinol wires, controls, etc..</p>
					<p>
						I made half-zip sweater that is wearable technology. The collar has nitinol shape alloy wire that is intertwined in a unique 3-D structure the iridescent fabric is shaped into. This allows the collar to expand and contract– giving it a variety of uses. It looks very elegant and high-class with a purpose. Whether the user is someone who is handicap or the user just has a handful of things or is doing activities such as exercising or skiing, the user just has to push the button on the left or right sleeve to activate the nitinol wire. The wire then convert electrical energy into mechanical energy by contracting the collar in closer to the neck while minimizing bulk and increasing style. It also will tighten the arm cuffs and the hem of the sweater to better trap in body heat to increase warmth and comfort.
